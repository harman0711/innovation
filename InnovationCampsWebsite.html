			<h3 align="center">Our idea</h3>
			<p align="center">We can create a tracking software to prevent marginalized students from dropping out
The program can take in attendance information gathered by teachers, look at trends in attendance and let software tell teachers which students are on their way out, or who need extra help to not drop out
Then all that is needed is for teachers to have pen paper and a PC, and require nothing from students</p>

	<div id="boks3" class="text"><h3 align="center">What does it do?</h3>
			<h5>We wanted to tackle:</h5>
		</n>
			<ul>
	        	<li> How can attendance and enrolment data prevent dropout in school?</li>
		     	<li>How can technology play a role in solving this issue?</li>
		    </ul>

			<h5>PenAndPaper does:</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Uses AI to analyze attendance statistics gathered by teachers, to help them get margnialized students the assitance they need.</li>
	         	<li>Helps diagnosing potential problems causing student drop out based on statistical trends.</li>
				<li>Improves student retention in low infrastucture areas</li>
				<li>Promotes economic growth in developing areas by increasing the amount of students finishing school to get higher paying jobs</li>
				<li>Most impressive: Even works during distance learning.</li>
			</ul>

	<div id="boks5" class="text">
			<h3 align="center">How does it work?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>As with the title it uses almost only pen and paper combined with centralized computing, using AI to analyze attendance data to return information to the teacher to help at risk student</li>
				<li>We took inspiration from the QR technology to create an easily digitized spread sheet using image to text technology</li>
				<li>Based on the data, an answer is returned to the teacher to help them target students in need of more help.</li>
				<li>We even included low infrastructure kit by using portable scanners and satellite telephone so that our system can work at places without reception.</li>
